        <h2>🚗 Let's Dive into the World of Engines! 🔧</h2>
        <p>
            Engines are the heart of any vehicle. They convert fuel into mechanical energy, which powers the vehicle. 
            There are various types of engines, including internal combustion engines, electric motors, and hybrid engines. 
            Each type has its own unique working mechanism and advantages. 🌟
        </p>

        <h2>🔥 Four-Stroke Internal Combustion Engine 🚀</h2>
        <p>
            The four-stroke internal combustion engine is the most common type of engine used in automobiles. 
            It operates on the principle of converting the chemical energy of fuel into mechanical energy through a series of controlled explosions. 💥
            The engine consists of several key components, including the cylinder, piston, crankshaft, camshaft, valves, and spark plug (in gasoline engines). ⚙️
        </p>
        <img src="./assets/images/stock-vector-four-stroke-internal-combustion-engine-vector-illustration-1307904541.jpg" alt="Four-Stroke Engine Diagram">
        <p>
            The four-stroke cycle consists of four distinct strokes: intake, compression, power, and exhaust. 
            Understanding how engines work is essential for anyone interested in automobiles, as it provides insight into the technology that powers our vehicles. 🚘
        </p>

        <h3>1️⃣ Intake Stroke 🌬️</h3>
        <p>
            The intake stroke begins when the piston moves downward from the top of the cylinder (Top Dead Center or TDC) to the bottom (Bottom Dead Center or BDC). 
            During this stroke, the intake valve opens, allowing the air-fuel mixture to enter the cylinder. 🛠️
        </p>

        <h3>2️⃣ Compression Stroke 💨</h3>
        <p>
            In the compression stroke, the piston moves upward from BDC to TDC. Both the intake and exhaust valves are closed, sealing the cylinder. 
            The air-fuel mixture is compressed into a smaller space, increasing its pressure and temperature. 🔥
        </p>

        <h3>3️⃣ Power Stroke ⚡</h3>
        <p>
            The power stroke is where the engine generates power. At TDC, the compressed air-fuel mixture is ignited by a spark plug (in gasoline engines) 
            or by the heat of compression (in diesel engines). The explosion forces the piston downward with great force. 💥🚀
        </p>

        <h3>4️⃣ Exhaust Stroke 🌫️</h3>
        <p>
            The exhaust stroke expels the burnt gases from the cylinder. The piston moves upward from BDC to TDC, and the exhaust valve opens. 
            The upward motion of the piston pushes the exhaust gases out through the exhaust valve and into the exhaust system. ♻️
